# LuaGObject

LuaGObject is a library which dynamically generates Lua bindings to libraries
which support GObject-Introspection such as Adwaita, Gtk, GLib, Gio, Cairo,
Pango, and many more.

This library is licensed under an
[MIT-style](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)
license. See the LICENSE file for the full text.

LuaGObject is tested and compatible with PUC-Rio Lua (versions 5.1, 5.2, 5.3,
and 5.4) as well as LuaJIT2. Other Lua implementations are not officially
supported.

This project is forked from [LGI](http://github.com/lgi-devs/lgi) and shares
many of its internals, quirks, and overall structure.

## Installation

In order to be able to compile the native part of LuaGObject,
GIRepository-2 >= 2.80.0 development package must be installed. The development
package is called `libgirepository-2.0-dev` on Debian-based systems (Debian,
Ubuntu, Mint, etc) and `glib2-devel` on RedHat-based systems (RHEL, Fedora,
etc).

### Using GNU Make

Building LuaGObject using GNU Make is relatively straightforward:

    make
    [sudo] make install [PREFIX=<prefix>] [DESTDIR=<destdir>]

Please note that on BSD-systems you may need to use the 'gmake' command.

By default, building with GNU Make does not support using pkg-config to detect
a system-installed Lua. For installing a development version of GObject with GNU
Make, it is recommended to install PUC-Rio Lua
[from source](https://www.lua.org/download.html).

### Using Meson

Building via Meson is also supported using Meson and Ninja as build tools,
also requiring GIRepository-2 >= 2.80.0 as noted above.

    cd $(builddir)
    meson $(lua_gobject_srcroot) [--prefix=<prefix>] [--buildtype=<buildtype>] [--pkg-config-path=<pkgconfigpath>] [-Dlua-pc=...] [-Dlua-bin=...]
    ninja
    ninja test
    [sudo] ninja install

Building LuaGObject with Visual Studio 2013 and later is also supported via
Meson. It is recommended in this case that CMake is also installed to
make finding Lua or LuaJIT easier, since Lua and LuaJIT support Visual
Studio builds via batch files or manual compilation of sources. Ensure
that `%INCLUDE%` includes the path to the Lua or LuaJIT headers, and
`%LIB%` includes the path where the `lua5x.lib` from Lua or LuaJIT can be
found, and ensure that `lua5x.dll` and `lua.exe` or `luajit.exe` can be
found in `%PATH%` and run correctly. For building with LuaJIT, please do
not pass in `-Dlua-pc=luajit`, but do pass in `-Dlua-bin=luajit` in the
Meson command line so that the LuaJIT interpreter can be found correctly.

## Usage

Documentation for LuaGObject is available in the `doc/` folder, formatted using
Markdown. To read the documentation using HTML, process the docs using your
preferred Markdown processor.

For developing a modern GNOME app, it is recommended to use Flatpak to ensure
stability of dynamically generated bindings. See
[Tally](https://github.com/vtrlx/tally) and
[Parchment](https://github.com/vtrlx/parchment) for examples of complete
applications developed using LuaGObject.

Older LGI-era examples are in the `samples/` directory. Please note that certain
examples—especially for Gtk—are quite dated and may no longer be accurate.

## Credits

LuaGObject would not be possible without the work of Christian Hergert, who
did the initial work on keeping LGI up to date.

- First version as "LuaGObject"
- Support for PUC-Rio Lua 5.4
- Support for Gtk4 and related libraries such as libAdwaita
- Now based on GIRepository-2.0, a hard requirement for using with GNOME 49 and
  later
- Support for building using Meson
